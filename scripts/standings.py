"""
standings.py -- NCAA 180 season-to-date standings across all 180 teams.

Writes data/OverallStandings_Season.csv (overwritten each run; also feeds columns A:K
of the poll Google Sheet):
  Playoff Rank, User ID, Team, League, Points, Wins, Losses, Ties,
  Exp Wins, Luck, Division Place

Points Rank, Last Week and the projection columns are formulas in the sheet,
so they are intentionally NOT produced here.

Rules:
  - Regular season only (weeks 1-11), completed weeks only (Outcome populated).
  - Ties count as 0.5 wins for all ranking (5-5-1 sits ahead of every 5-win team).
  - Ranking order: Wins + 0.5*Ties desc, then Points desc. No H2H.
  - Exp Wins: sum over weeks of (teams outscored that week / 179), all 180 teams.
    An exact points tie with another team counts as half a team beaten.
  - Luck = Wins + 0.5*Ties - Exp Wins.
  - Exact Wins+Points ties share a rank and the next rank is skipped (6,7,7,9).
  - Division Place is within League + Division (West/East names repeat across leagues).

CWD must be repo root, same as every other script.
