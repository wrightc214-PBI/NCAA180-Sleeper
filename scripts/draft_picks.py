"""
draft_picks.py -- who owns every future rookie-draft pick, in all 15 leagues.

Writes data/FuturePicks_Current.csv (overwritten each run):
  LeagueID, LeagueName, Season, Round, OriginalRosterID, OwnerRosterID

How ownership is built (per league):
  1. Default: every roster owns its own pick in each round (settings.draft_rounds).
  2. Sleeper's /traded_picks lists every pick that changed hands: roster_id = original
     team, owner_id = current owner (both roster IDs). Those override the default.
  3. Seasons counted: every season Sleeper reports in traded_picks, plus the standard
     current..current+2 tradable window -- minus any season whose rookie draft is
     already complete (traded_picks keeps listing those after the draft).

Fails per league without stopping the others; a failed league keeps last run's rows,
and the run is flagged (exit 1) so it shows in the Actions summary.
CWD must be repo root.
