"""
orphans.py -- registry of orphaned rosters (no real coach), past and present.

Writes:
  data/Orphans.csv  one row per orphan run:
    Team, League, LeagueName, RosterID, PreviousOwnerID, PreviousOwnerName,
    OrphanedYear, OrphanedWeek, Status (Active/Filled),
    FilledYear, FilledWeek, NewOwnerID, NewOwnerName
  data/RosterOwners_LastSeen.csv  each roster's owner at the last run. Needed because
    league_matchups.py stamps the CURRENT owner on every week of the season, so a
    mid-season departure would otherwise erase who the previous owner was.

"Orphan" = OwnerID == "Orphan" in the Matchups files (set by league_matchups.py and
patch_orphans_historic.py: caretaker, vacant, or deleted-account rosters).

First run (no Orphans.csv yet): seeds every orphan run found in Matchups_Historic +
Matchups_Season. Before tracking began only the season is known, so OrphanedWeek and
FilledWeek are blank on seeded rows.

Every later run: compares current owners with the registry.
  - newly orphaned roster  -> new Active row, OrphanedWeek = current week
  - Active roster now owned -> Status Filled, FilledYear/Week, NewOwner*
"Current week" = first regular/post-season week without final results (the week in
progress or about to start).

Rosters are matched across seasons by LeagueName + RosterID (LeagueIDs change yearly).
Team names come from the current-season Teams.csv.

CWD must be repo root. No API calls -- reads only files the pipeline already wrote,
so run it after `matchups`.
