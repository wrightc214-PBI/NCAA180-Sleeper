"""
week_status.py -- which NFL weeks are finished (imported by other scripts, not run).

Why: league_matchups.py sets Outcome as soon as a matchup has any points, so during a
live week (e.g. after Thursday night) many rows already say Win/Loss. "Every row has an
Outcome" therefore does NOT mean the week is over. The authority is Sleeper's NFL state:
during the regular season, weeks before state.week are complete.

completed_weeks(year)  -> sorted list of finished week numbers (1..18) for that season
current_week(year)     -> the week in progress / next to be played

Sleeper state is fetched once per job and cached in data/NFLState.json (not committed).
If Sleeper can't be reached, falls back to the cached file, then to the old rule
(every matchup row has an Outcome) with a warning.
